# Tangram Referential Communication Task

A gameified implementation of the referential communication task described by Beechey et. al. (2019).

The task requires the participant to find a path from the top-left cell of the grid to the bottom-right cell by moving horizontally or vertically between cells which share either the same colour or the same tangram image.

In two-participant mode each person sees only half the puzzle content with each individual having a complementary view which is not sufficient to navigate through the puzzle alone. The task for two participants is to verbally exchange information with each other to make it possible for both participants to find a path through the puzzle together.

Each participant's moves are recorded in a CSV file along with timestamps for later analysis.

# Building the game executable

To build the source first install the [love2d](https://www.love2d.org/) game engine. The download the [boon](https://github.com/camchenry/boon) build tool. From within the source directory execute the command:

```
boon build . --target windows
```

to create a Windows executable. Or:

```
boon build . --target macos
```

to create a MacOS application.

# Running the game

The game executable can be run by double clicking on the application icon. A start-up menu provides text boxes to enter the ID and group of each participant. In two-participant mode, participants must be assigned to `player 1` or `player 2`. To ensure that each participant sees the same puzzles, the same random seed must be entered for both participants.
