# Tangram Referential Communication Task

A gameified implementation of the referential communication task described by Beechey et. al. (2019).

The task requires the player to find a path from the top-left cell of the grid to the bottom-right cell by moving horizontally or vertically between cells which share either the same colour or the same tangram image.
