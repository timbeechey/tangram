# Tangram Referential Communication Task

A gameified implementation of the referential communication task described by Beechey et. al. (2019).

The task requires the player to find a path from the top-left cell of the grid to the bottom-right cell by moving horizontally or vertically between cells which share either the same colour or the same tangram image.

In two-player mode each player sees only half the puzzle content with each player having a complementary view. The task for two players is to verbally exchange information with one-another to make it possible for both players to find a path through the puzzle.
